/** @defgroup tof_gestures_DIRSWIPE_1 Directional SWIPE (1)
 *  @brief    Directional (left/right) Swipe gesture detection based on motion detector (dual ToF devices)
    @par Description
    This tof_gestures module allows to detect a directional swipe (from left to right or from right to left) using
    two ToF devices (left and right). It is based on the tof_motion module with simple threshold and timing considerations.
    It returns one of the following gestures codes : ::GESTURES_SWIPE_LEFT_RIGHT, ::GESTURES_SWIPE_RIGHT_LEFT when gesture is detected
    or ::GESTURES_NULL, ::GESTURES_DISCARDED_TOO_SLOW or ::GESTURES_DISCARDED_TOO_FAST when no gesture is detected.
    @par Known Limitations
    None (very fast swipes can be detected)
